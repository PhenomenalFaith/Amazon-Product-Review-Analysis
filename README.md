### Dataset Cleaning.
  The uncleaned dataset consisted of 16 columns and 1465 rows, of which the product detail had the name, category, discount, and  ratings. The customer engagement had the user review, titles, and content. Each unique product ID had aggregated reviewers' data(User ID and Review ID) in the form of comma-separated values (8 each per cell).

Columns that were unnecessary for the analysis, like Image link, User name, etc, were removed. Also using the delimeter(|), the Product category was split into columns and cleaned. The comma-separated values  in the review ID & user ID were separated to give a clean data set. The proper function, Trim, Clean, IF function were used to get a clean dataset as well as the calculated columns.
